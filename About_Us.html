            <p>Hi, we are Tina and Jacopo and in the vibrant autumn of 2023, a synergistic partnership was forged within the halls of Northeastern University, where we embarked on a journey pursuing an MFA in Information Design and Data Visualization. Our convergence was not merely fortuitous; it stemmed from a rich and diverse cultural backgrounds, bound together by a commitment to understanding complex systems.</p>
            <p>This dynamic alliance brought together the insightful prowess of Jacopo (BA Philosophy and Art History, University of Lausanne), adept at critically framing and dissecting intricate societal issues, with Tina's formidable engineering acumen (BS Mechanical Engineering, MIT), honed through five years of consulting experience. Under the guidance of our esteemed Professor Nil Tuzuc of the Harvard Growth Lab, we embarked on a collaborative endeavor to translate intricate concepts into tangible forms, leveraging the power of data visualization.</p>
            <p>Our latest endeavor, an in-depth exploration into Swiss exports, emerged as the culmination of our efforts in the ARTG-5330 class project. Through this venture, we sought to cultivate technical prowess in harnessing data through HTML, CSS, and D3 to craft immersive digital experiences. Your interest in our project is deeply appreciated, and we eagerly welcome any feedback or inquiries.
            </p>
